        "Here are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) explained:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** This means keeping the data (variables) and the code (methods) that works on the data together in one unit called a class. It also involves controlling access to the data so that it’s protected from being changed directly, usually through functions or methods. Think of it like putting important documents in a secure folder, only allowing access to them through a safe process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:** This is about hiding the complex details and showing only the essential features to the user. It's like using a remote control – you don’t need to know how the TV works internally, you just press buttons to get it to do what you want.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** Inheritance allows one class (the child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (the parent). It's like a child inheriting traits from their parents – they get things like hair color or height, but they can also add their own unique traits.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** This means that a single method can work in different ways depending on the object it’s being used with. It’s like a person being able to drive different types of vehicles – a car, a motorcycle, or a truck – but the action \"driving\" remains the same even though the vehicle is different.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classes and Objects:** A class is like a blueprint, and an object is an actual instance of that blueprint. It’s like a blueprint for a house – the class is the plan, and the object is the actual house built from that plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts together help make code more organized, reusable, and easier to manage."
