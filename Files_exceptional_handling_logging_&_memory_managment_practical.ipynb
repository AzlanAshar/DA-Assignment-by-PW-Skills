        "   - 'RotatingFileHandler(\"my_log.log\", maxBytes=1e6, backupCount=3)': This handler writes log messages to a file named \"my_log.log\". The 'maxBytes' parameter specifies that the log file should be rotated after it reaches 1MB (1e6 bytes).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **'with open(file_name, 'r') as file'**:\n",
        "   - The 'open()' function is used with the 'with' statement. The 'with' statement automatically handles opening and closing the file.\n",
        "   - 'r' mode is used to open the file for reading.\n",
        "   - The 'file' variable represents the opened file inside the 'with' block.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reading the File**:\n",
        "   - The 'file.read()' method reads the entire content of the file into a string.\n",
        "   - You can also use 'file.readline()' to read one line at a time or 'file.readlines()' to read all lines into a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Context Manager**:\n",
        "   - The context manager ensures that the file is properly closed once the block is exited, even if an error occurs during reading.\n",
        "   - If the file does not exist, a 'FileNotFoundError' is raised, which is caught by the 'except' block, and a friendly error message is displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Notes**:\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: If the file does not exist or there's another issue opening the file, the 'FileNotFoundError' is caught and an error message is printed.\n",
        "- **Context Manager Advantage**: Using a 'with' statement is a good practice because it ensures that the file is closed even if an error occurs, eliminating the need for a 'file.close()' call."

        "#### **Explanation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Logging Configuration**:\n",
        "   - 'logging.basicConfig()': This sets up the logging configuration.\n",
        "   - 'filename='file_handling_errors.log'': This specifies the name of the log file where the error messages will be written.\n",
        "   - 'level=logging.ERROR': This means only errors ('ERROR' and 'CRITICAL') will be logged. You can change this to 'logging.DEBUG' if you want to log more information.\n",
        "   - 'format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'': This formats the log message to include the timestamp, the log level, and the message.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Handling in 'read_file()'**:\n",
        "   - 'FileNotFoundError': Logs the error message if the file doesn't exist.\n",
        "   - 'PermissionError': Logs the error if the program doesn't have permission to read the file.\n",
        "   - 'Exception': Catches any other unexpected errors and logs them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - The 'read_file()' function is called with a file name (''example.txt''), and if any error occurs, it is logged to ''file_handling_errors.log''.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Notes**:\n",
        "- The log file 'file_handling_errors.log' will be created in the current working directory. You can change the path if you want it to be stored in a different directory.\n",
        "- You can also adjust the log level ('logging.DEBUG', 'logging.INFO', etc.) based on the type of information you want to log.\n",
        "- The 'try-except' blocks ensure that specific errors (like file not found or permission issues) are logged with a detailed message."
